"""One SQLite connection, owned by one thread, reached only through this class.

## Why a single thread and not a lock

The obvious design is ``asyncio.to_thread`` guarded by an ``asyncio.Lock``::

    async with self._lock:                    # DO NOT
        return await asyncio.to_thread(work)

It is broken. Cancelling the task while it awaits ``to_thread`` unwinds the ``async
with`` and releases the lock, but **does not cancel the thread**: ``work`` is still
running on the shared connection, mid-transaction, when the next task takes the lock and
calls into that same connection from a different thread. A client disconnecting cancels
its request task, so this is an ordinary Tuesday rather than a thought experiment.

A single-worker executor removes the failure instead of patching it. Serialization stops
depending on a lock that cancellation can drop, and becomes a property of there being
exactly one thread that may touch the connection at all.

## What that buys, and what it costs

Every database call is submitted as *one whole callable*, so a transaction is indivisible
by construction rather than by convention -- which is what the invariants above this
layer are built on. It is strictly stronger than the per-store ``asyncio.Lock``\\ s it
replaces: those let calls to different stores interleave, and nothing interleaves here.
Exactly one thread ever exists, so there is no pool to exhaust.

The cost, and it belongs in the open: **a cancelled request's write may still commit**,
because the queued callable runs to completion regardless of who is still waiting for it.
That is not new -- the in-memory stores had no ``await`` inside their locks either, so
their bodies always ran to completion once entered -- but it is now worth knowing.

## The pragma that lies

``PRAGMA foreign_keys`` defaults to **off**, is per-connection rather than stored in the
file, and -- the part that costs an afternoon -- is a **silent no-op when a transaction
is open**. Issued through a driver that opens implicit transactions around DML, it can
report success and do nothing, leaving every foreign key in the schema decorative and
every cascade absent. That is why the connection is opened with ``isolation_level=None``
(this class issues its own ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``) and why the setting is read back and
verified rather than assumed.

``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` rather than a deferred ``BEGIN`` that upgrades to a write lock
partway through: the deferred form is where ``SQLITE_BUSY`` and writer deadlock live, and
the immediate form is what makes a check-then-write pair serializable even if a
connection pool ever replaces the single connection here.

## The file mode is the only thing protecting this file

SQLite creates its files 0644. keyring at least encrypts its credential material, so a
world-readable file there leaks metadata; here **nothing is encrypted at all**. A persona
is a person's own words about themselves and an assistant's notes about them, in
plaintext, and 0644 would hand every one of them to every other process on the box. The
mode is not defence in depth here. It is the defence.

``synchronous = NORMAL`` is the one pragma that differs from keyring, which uses
``FULL``. The difference is a judgement about what a lost commit costs, and the two
services answer it differently:

* In keyring a lost commit is a credential somebody believes is saved and is not --
  discovered later, by something failing to authenticate, with no way to tell what went.
* Here a lost commit is a forgotten note. Annoying, recoverable by writing it again, and
  visible immediately to the assistant that wrote it.

Write volume also differs by orders of magnitude: keyring writes a few times a minute,
and an assistant with a persona may write on every turn. WAL with ``NORMAL`` **cannot
corrupt the database** -- it can only lose the last commits on power loss, because the
WAL is still fsynced at every checkpoint. Trading that against an fsync per commit is
the right way round for this service. See docs/adr/0008-sqlite.md.
