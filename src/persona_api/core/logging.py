"""Structured logging, with a redaction pass that runs before anything is rendered.

JSON in deployment so records are queryable, pretty console output locally. Every record
carries the request id and the authenticated account when there is one, which is what
makes a single person's activity traceable across endpoints.

The redaction processor is kept from keyring, and it earns its place here for a reason
that is easy to miss: this service *refuses* credentials rather than storing them, and
the refusal path is the one most likely to want to log what it refused. A rejected value
is still a live API key. It is redacted by field name rather than by asking every call
site to remember, because "remember not to log the value" is a rule that holds until the
one exception handler that logs its whole context.

A persona is not a secret, but it is personal: what an assistant has noticed about
somebody is exactly the sort of thing that should not be sitting in an aggregator. Field
values and note bodies are therefore never logged either -- see ``_SENSITIVE_SUBSTRINGS``
and the test that proves the processor is installed rather than merely written.
